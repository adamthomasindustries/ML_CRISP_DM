These are files I created as part of uni studies for a course called Data Science with Python. They explore basic machine learning models such as linear regression, k-means clustering and decision trees to inform business decisions. The dataset contained employee survey responses, from a fictional organisation, that aimed to examine the climate of the organisation. Sentiment analysis was also conducted on the responses to assess employee attitudes about the organisation.
